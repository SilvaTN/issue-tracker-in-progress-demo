I am developing an issue tracker.
<br /> The web app can be viewed here https://silvatn.github.io/issue-tracker-in-progress-demo/

<br /> The original repo can be viewed here https://github.com/SilvaTN/issue-tracker

<br /> Right now, most things are placeholders.
<br />
<br />Eventually, the app will include these features:
    <br /> -You can demo it without logging in, but any input data will not be stored. 
    <br /> -You can create an account and sign in, which will allow you to use this web application to its fullest potential and will solve literally all problems you have in your life, as long as the problems you have are all related to needing an issue tracker. <br />
    <br /> -It will rid the world of all its problems, assuming that they are all related to, again, needing an issue tracker, which they are. <br />
